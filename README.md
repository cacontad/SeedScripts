# SeedScripts
# Scripts provided for the Paper "Metabolic modelling of isoflavone accumulation in wild and cultivated soybean seeds elucidates the role of maternal contribution"
By Carolina A. Contador, Ailin Liu, Ming-Sin Ng, Yee-Shan Ku, Siu H. J. Chan, and Hon-Ming Lam 

## The provided scripts require the following tools to be available:

Cobra Toolbox ([available here](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox)) and Gurobi (Academic licenses are available free of charge via the ([Gurobi academic program](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/)). The solver used in the paper was Gurobi v9.5.0.  


## Matlab Function Descriptions:
All Matlab Scripts are contained in the *Matlab* folder.
validation.m - Model against published experimental data.
post_processing.m - sampling and remove thermodynamically infeasible internal cycles in the flux distributions from the sampling.
Models folder - C08 and W05 Cotyledon models


## Soybean model:
xml files were downloaded from supplementary material of ([Moreira et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00122)).
